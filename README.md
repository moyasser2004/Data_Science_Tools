# Youm7 Web Scraping and Summarization

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data science tool designed to scrape news articles from the popular Egyptian news website **Youm7** and generate concise, meaningful summaries for easier consumption and analysis. Leveraging advanced web scraping techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, the system automates the process of collecting, summarizing, and storing news data for further analysis or retrieval.

## Key Features

### 1. **Web Scraping**
- Automatically extracts news articles, headlines, and metadata (e.g., publication date, category, author) from Youm7.
- Handles dynamic content using tools like Selenium or BeautifulSoup.
- Robust mechanisms to deal with anti-scraping measures and ensure reliable data collection.

### 2. **Summarization**
- Uses state-of-the-art NLP models (e.g., Hugging Face transformers or custom-trained models) to generate concise summaries.
- Supports both extractive and abstractive summarization approaches.
- Ensures summaries retain the critical essence and key points of the articles.

### 3. **Data Storage**
- Stores scraped and summarized data in a structured format using:
  - Relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for structured queries.
  - NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) for scalability and flexibility.
- Enables efficient retrieval for future analysis or visualization.

### 4. **Multi-Language Support**
- Incorporates language models tailored for Arabic text processing to handle the native language of Youm7 articles.

### 5. **Analytics and Visualization (Optional)**
- Provides insights into trending topics, article sentiments, and publication frequency.
- Uses tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Tableau for visual representation.

## Technologies Used

### Programming Languages:
- **Python**: Core language for web scraping, NLP, and backend processing.

### Libraries and Frameworks:
- **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium**: For web scraping.
- **NLTK**, **spaCy**, and **Hugging Face Transformers**: For text preprocessing and summarization.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database interaction.

### Databases:
- **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**: For relational data storage.
- **MongoDB**: For NoSQL storage.

### Additional Tools:
- **Flask** or **Django**: To create a backend API for interacting with the scraped data.
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.8 or higher.
2. pip (Python package manager).
3. Browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver) if using Selenium.
4. Access to a database (e.g., MySQL or MongoDB).

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/youm7-web-scraping.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd youm7-web-scraping
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up environment variables for database credentials and API keys (if any).
5. Run the scraper:
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```
6. Generate summaries:
   ```bash
   python summarizer.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Scraping Articles**:
   - Execute the scraper script to fetch articles from Youm7.
   - Configure the scraper to target specific sections or time periods.

2. **Generating Summaries**:
   - Run the summarizer script to process scraped articles and generate summaries.

3. **Accessing Data**:
   - Use the database API to query and retrieve stored articles and summaries.

## Future Enhancements
- **Real-Time Scraping**: Automate periodic scraping to keep the database updated with the latest news.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Build a frontend for visualizing trends and accessing summaries.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrate sentiment analysis to understand the tone of articles.
- **Translation**: Add support for translating Arabic summaries into other languages.
